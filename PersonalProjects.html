            <h3>Unity 3D</h3>
            <br/>
                <p>I recently began working my way through the recommended tutorials for Unity 3D. I have completed the Roll-A-Ball Game tutorial:

                    <br/><br/>
                    This tutorial covers the basics of using Unity3D. It introduces you to creating objects with physics, basic player movement, and collecting objects.

            <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
            <p>These Adobe Photoshop projects are from my Fundamentals of Digital Media class. Each project displays different skills that I learned in Photoshop.</p>
            <h4>Project Green</h4>
            <img src='GreenPhotoshop.PNG' alt='Project Green' width='660' height='500'>
            <p>This piece uses the cropping and brush tools. The aim of this project was to take several images at the greenhouse located at UC and to make a postcard for an imaginary UC Plant Club. </p>
            <h4>Verticality</h4>
            <img src='VerticalityPhotoshop.PNG' alt='Verticality' width='660' height='500'>
            <p>Verticality was a project I did that involved changing the color and opacity of layers to create the illusion that the images were part of the walls.</p>
            <h4>Panels</h4>
            <img src='PanelsPhotoshop.PNG' alt='Panels' width='660' height='500'>
            <p>In Panels I had to take a picture of someone I knew, find a piece of art, and find a quote from a poet. This piece uses a gradient for the background and practices the typography tool.</p>
            <h4>Fantastical Night at UC</h4>
            <p>Fantastical Night at UC was the final project for this class. I based this piece off of the DLC for Destiny 2: Foresaken. </p> <p>In this DLC, a character named Cayde-6 is murdered. I chose to embody the five stages of grief in this project: Denial, Bargaining, Anger, Depression, and Acceptance.</p>

            <h3>Research Papers</h3>
            
            
            <p>My senior year of high school, I wrote a <a href= "http://homepages.uc.edu/~seiberme/MaggieSeibertSeniorThesisCLS.pdf">twelve page paper</a> that discussed whether or not Artificial Intelligence is a threat to humanity. 
                <br/>I state both sides of the argument and then follow up with my viewpoint. 
                I think that Artificial Intelligence and Humanity work better hand-in-hand.</p>
            <p>I wrote a <a href="http://homepages.uc.edu/~seiberme/WhatEffectsDoVideoGamesHaveonModernSociety.pdf">paper</a> for my Implications of IT class that discusses the effects video games have on society.</p>
